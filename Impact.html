        <h2>Impact of E-waste on people and environment</h2>

                E-waste is the fastest-growing solid waste stream globally.
                In 2022, an estimated 62 million tonnes of e-waste were generated, but only 22.3% was formally collected and recycled.
                This waste contains toxic materials that, if not managed properly, can cause serious harm to human health and the environment.
                The problem is particularly severe in low- and middle-income countries, where there is a lack of adequate infrastructure for safe management.

            Exposure to e-waste can have serious consequences.
            Toxic substances released during informal recycling such as lead, mercury, and dioxins, are known to cause neurological, respiratory, and behavioral damage.
            Children are particularly vulnerable because exposure can lead to problems with cognitive and behavioral development, as well as disorders such as ADHD.
            Pregnant women exposed to e-waste may also suffer adverse effects, such as premature birth or fetal development defects.

                The improper disposal of e-waste contributes significantly to environmental pollution.
                Toxic substances can contaminate the soil, water, and air, putting biodiversity and ecosystem health at risk.
                Additionally, open burning and the use of acids release up to 1,000 harmful chemicals into the environment.
                These practices not only harm the environment but are also a serious menaces to local communities living near informal disposal sites.

                It is essential to strengthen the health sectorâ€™s capacity to recognize and reduce exposure to e-waste.
                It is recommended to improve the safe collection, formal recycling, and treatment of electronic devices.
                Furthermore, the WHO emphasizes the importance of educating people on how to recycle correctly and involving all sectors, including education and labor.
