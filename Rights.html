                E-waste has many implications on human rights, especially in places where the E-waste is<br>
                being dumped and processed without the rights procedures and as a result it brings many<br>
                trouble to both the environment and the people.

        <p style="order:-1">
            First of all it violates the art. 6 where is written that “Every human being has the inherent<br>
            right to life. This right shall be protected by law” since E-waste release toxic substances, that<br> 
            are dangerous to human life and can cause illnesses such as chronic gastritis,ulcers <br>
            and respiratory problems, Therefore E-waste is not only a problem to the environment,.<br> 
            but also to human rights

        </p>

        <div class="flex-box">
            <img src="images/food.jpg" width="320px" height="220px">
            <p>
                Second of all it breaches the art. 25, it says that “Everyone has the right to a standard of<br>
                living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food”<br>
                as E-waste spread harmful materials it doesn't only affect people and environment,<br>
                but also the food we eat consequently it may result in damage to our health. 
            </p>

        <p style="order:-1">
            Moreover it breaks the art. 18 which says that“workers shall have the right to remove<br>
            themselves from danger resulting from the use of chemicals when they have reasonable <br>
            justification to believe there is an imminent and serious risk to their safety or health.”<br>
            because many laborer work in E-waste recycling centers with low health standard and are<br>
            in direct contact with the harmful chemicals, sometimes without them knowing and with<br>
            none of the security precautions they should have.
