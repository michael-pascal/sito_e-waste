                We both are students attending the third year of high school at blaise pascal, more specifically the IT branch.
                We find the argument of E-waste interesting and something we need to talk about.
                We reckon that is so important to speak about it because that’s such a high priority for our health and the one of our future generation.
                E-waste is a critical issue that demands our attention, especially as we, as IT students, are more connected to technology than ever before.
                It’s essential that we raise awareness about this issue and promote responsible disposal and recycling practices. As future IT professionals, we have a responsibility to lead by example and create sustainable solutions for the tech world.
