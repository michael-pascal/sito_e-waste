                A large part of e-waste is recycled in an incorrect and dangerous way, putting our local communities at risk.
                These areas lack adequate infrastructure for the proper and safe disposal of e-waste.
                Furthermore, the lack of awareness and the limited involvement of producers prevent the adoption of sustainable solutions.

            A wrong way of recycling is through open burning, acid immersion, and manual disassembly without protection.
            These practices release up to 1,000 harmful chemical substances, including lead, mercury, and dioxins, contaminating the air, soil, and water.
            Moreover, despite international regulations, e-waste is very often illegally exported to developing countries, worsening the risks for local communities.

                The World Health Organization calls for urgent action to protect the environment and public health.
                The proposals include educating communities, empowering producers, and investing in safe recycling technologies.
                We need strong policies, collaboration between countries, and a global vision to address this problem that affects every one of us.
                Only by working together will it be possible to reduce the impact of e-waste and build a healthier and more sustainable future.
