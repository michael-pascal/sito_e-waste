        <h2>Work exploitation</h2>

                In addition to the many problems it brought to the environment, E-waste also brought many <br> 
                issues to the world of work,many people that struggle to find a job work end up <br>
                in E-waste recycling centers in which they are usually exploited. This situation happens<br>
                in both developing and developed countries.

            These workers normally come from poorer countries where they are pretty much forced <br>
            to work, otherwise they wouldn’t have any money to buy food so their only option is to work<br>
            under these E-waste centers even though they know they are being exploited.

        <div class="flex-box">

            <p style="order:-1">
                moreover these recycling centers make the workers under them work in extremely harsh<br>
                conditions in which they labour with very toxic substances besides getting underpaid,<br>
                sometimes what they earn isn’t enough for their basic necessities so even children <br>
                have to work.

                The objective of these E-waste centers is to take E-waste,make the workers extract the<br>
                materials and resell them for a profit,an example of countries where this happened or still<br>
                happens is in China and Palestine.
