                E-waste is a problem we all have to face ,but what is it? E-waste refers to those devices,<br>
                such as computers,phones or home appliances that have been discarded by people,<br>
                whether they work or not.This trash is really dangerous because of some toxic <br>
                chemicals they release when buried underground.

        <p style="order:-1">
            Since the last few decades with the evolution of technology there has been an extremely fast<br>
            increase of new devices and with it  electronic waste, this affected both developed and <br>
            developing countries,in 2014-2016 there has been an increase of 8% of E-waste in only 2 <br>
            years with millions of metric tonnes,but only a small 20% of it was recycled.

                So where does so much garbage end up? For many years it ended up in landfills where they <br>
                gather from around the world millions and millions of tonnes, there are many landfills like this <br>
                for example Guiyu in China,Manila bay in the Philippines and Yound√© in Cameroon,nowadays<br>
                Countries around the world are trying to decrease the amount of e-waste and they are trying<br>
                to find a solution to this problem.
